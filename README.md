## How to play the drum? 
1. You can either click the buttons with your mouse or press the key on your keyboard.
2. Even if it calls drum, the corelate sound may play longer than you anticipated.
3. When you press multiple button, and you don't feel like the music harmony is aweful and too noizy, please reload the window.
4. * Sorry, I am not a musician, so the sound combination might not please your ears.
